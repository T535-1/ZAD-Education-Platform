ZAD Education Platform - Views Module
======================================
Dashboard views for all user roles.

Note: Individual views should be imported directly from their modules
to avoid circular import issues.

Example:
    from views.admin import show_admin_dashboard
    from views.teacher import show_teacher_dashboard
"""

# Do NOT import views here to avoid circular imports
# Modules are imported directly where needed
